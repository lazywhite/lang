    1. always use lowercase attribute
    2. always quote attribute value
    3. html element is everything from start tag to end tag
    4. element can contain other element(nested)
    5. use lowercase tagname
    6. Meta data means data about data. HTML meta data is data about the HTML document.
    7. A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
        An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
    8. Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).
    9. A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line
    10. URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.
    URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
    URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.
    URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.
    11. the readonly attribute specifies that the input field is read only (cannot be changed)
    The disabled attribute specifies that the input field is disabled.
    A disabled element is un-usable and un-clickable.
    Disabled elements will not be submitted.
    12. display:none element will take no space of page, visibility:hidden still take up the same space as before
    13. An outline is a line drawn around an element - outside the border, it's not a part of element

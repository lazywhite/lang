## Topic
1. variable name should never start with '$'
2. java ignore blank lines
3. java allow single inherients
4. an interface can be defined as a contract between objects on how to communicate with each other
5. an interface defines the methods, a deriving class(subclass) should use, but the implemention of methods is totally up to the subclass
6. if we don't explicitly write a constructor for a class, the java compiler builds a default constructor for that class
7. each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked
constructor should have same name with class, a class can have more than one constructor
8. there can be only one public class per source file
9. a source file can have multiple non public classes
10. the public class name should be the name of source file
11. if the class is defined inside a package , the package statement should be the first statement in the source file
12. import statement should be written between package statement and class declaration
13. import and package statement will imply to all the classes present in the source file
14. classes have several access level: final, abstract etc.
15. java package is a way of categorizing the classes and interfaces
16. variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values
17. you must declare all variables before they can be used
18. instance variable have default values, number default is 0, boolean default is false,  object reference default null
19. A literal is the source code representation of a fixed value; literals are represented directly in your code without requiring computation
20. Primitive types are special data types built into the language; they are not objects created from a class
21. Always use 'single quotes' for char literals and "double quotes" for String literals.



## Format output
```
%b boolean
%d digital
%s string
%n nextline
%<.number>f float
